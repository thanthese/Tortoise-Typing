python switch, which will be true for almost all modern distributions.

# Quick Start

`<esc>` ends the program.

`:TutorialTyping` starts the two-minute tutorial.

`:TortoiseTyping` starts the program with default settings: "A Christmas
Carol" text, shuffled sentence order, and 150 word session.

`:FileTyping <filepath>` starts like `:TortoiseTyping`, but with the file
`<filepath>` of your choice.

# Advanced Options and Features

The main screen has a progress bar showing percent completion through text.
Use the tab key to toggle graphical/fraction representation.  Below that are
words-per-minute and accuracy statistics.

Main program options:

- `filepath`: choose source file
- `randomize`: whether or not to shuffle sentence order
- `wordcount`: truncates source to wordcount number of words

The main entry point into the program is the python `startTyping()` function.
The `:TortoiseTyping` command calls it like this:

    ```vim command! TortoiseTyping py startTyping( \
                                          filepath  = "xmasCarol.txt", \
                                          randomize = True, \
                                          wordCount = 150) ```

Feel free to use combinations of commands, mappings, and functions to
customize how the program starts.
